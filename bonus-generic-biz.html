            <p>I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I'll go
                over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown,
                Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Don't be bashful drop me a line. We'll paint
                one happy little tree right here.
                <br>
                <br>Let your imagination be your guide. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it
                fall where it will. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody
                absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Let's have a happy little
                tree in here. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. We'll put a happy
                little bush here.

            <p>It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. From all of us here, I want to wish
                you happy painting and God bless, my friends. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do
                is just let it flow right out of us. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Let's get
                wild today. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.
                <br>
                <br>It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. I
                like to beat the brush. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.</p>
